        <p>Cycling is an excellent stress buster. Children have a hectic day at school and feel completely drained out in the evenings. A bicycle ride can help them recharge their energy. Being out on their own after a long day in school helps them relieve their stress and make them happier.Although itâ€™s a known fact that cycling is a good exercise for the legs, it strengthens the entire body. It builds and strengthens muscles slowly and steadily. If you are worried about stressing your child by making them cycle, then wipe off that worry as cycling is slow, but an effective activity that helps your child in the long run.Cycling is an excellent workout for the large muscles in the legs. When the leg muscles are exercised, the heart rate increases, thereby accelerating the stamina in the body. It exercises the cardiovascular muscles and keeps a check on the weight of your child, helping him/her attain the ideal weight.</p>
